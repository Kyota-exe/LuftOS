# LuftOS
LuftOS is an operating system I'm making as a hobby for educational purposes. I originally started it's development following [this tutorial series](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLxN4E629pPnJxCQCLy7E0SQY_zuumOVyZ). I have since been attempting to implement features such as a GUI (I am currently working on this).

## Roadmap
#### From the tutorial series:
- Basic bootloader [COMPLETED]
- Paging [COMPLETED]

#### Outside of the tutorial series:
- Loading BMP image as desktop background [COMPLETED]
- Graphical User Interface
- Shell
- Many more features to come!
